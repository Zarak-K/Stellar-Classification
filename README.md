# Stellar-Classification
A fundamental classification scheme in astronomy involves categorizing objects into galaxies, quasars and stars. A dataset consisting of 100,000 observations taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survery (SDSS) was obtained from Kaggle. Each observation is described by 17 features and 1 class column identifying it as a galaxy, quasar or star.
